The Biosynthetic Gene cluster Meta'omics abundance Profiler (BiG-MAP)
is currently in development. For the analysis of bacterial metagenomic
and metatranscriptomic samples more and more tools become
available. This tool is focussed on finding the representation of
primary metabolic pathways and their related homologs in metagenomic
and metatranscriptomic samples. These pathways are readily obtained
from (draft) bacterial genomes using antiSMASH or gutSMASH. To be able
to process the outputs from these tools into proper abundance and
expressions values, the following programs form the essential part of
BiG-MAP:
- BiG-MAP.download.py
- BiG-MAP.family.py
- BiG-MAP.map.py
- BiG-MAP.analyse.py
For information on how to implement this program, scroll down to
*Overview and quickstart*. 

* Installation
Install BiG-MAP dependencies using conda. Conda can be installed from
[[https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html][miniconda_link]]. First pull the BiG-MAP repository from github:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
~$ git clone https://github.com/KoenvdBerg/BiG-MAP.git
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then install all the dependencies from the BiG-MAP.yml file with:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# For BiG-MAP.download.py, BiG-MAP.family.py and BiG-MAP.map.py
~$ conda env create -f BiG-MAP_process.yml BiG-MAP_process
~$ conda activate BiG-MAP_process

# For BiG-MAP.analyse.py
~$ conda env create -f BiG-MAP_analyse.yml BiG-MAP_analyse
~$ conda activate BiG-MAP_analyse

#+END_EXAMPLE
After this all the dependencies are installed. BiG-MAP can now be used. 

* Example Workflow
A typical workflow for BiG-MAP consists of the following 4 consecutive steps:
1) Downloading WGS data using BiG-MAP.download.py
2) Generating gene cluster families (GCFs) and housekeeping gene
   families (HGFs) using BiG-MAP.family.py
3) Computing abundance and expression profiles of selected
   representatives from each GCF and HGF using BiG-MAP.map.py
4) Analysing the resulting BIOM file for profiles using
   BiG-MAP.analyse.py
The four steps are described below, and for each an example is
provided. 

** 1) BiG-MAP.download.py
This script is created to easily download the metagenomic and/or
metatranscriptomic samples from the online NCBI repository. First, the
samples are downloaded in /.SRA/ format, and then they are converted
into /.fastq/ pairs using /fastq-dump/. 
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
python3 BiG-MAP.download.py [Options]* -A [accession_list_file] -O [path_to_outdir]
#+END_EXAMPLE
To download the 78 samples from Schirmer et al. (2018), go to the [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/][SRA
run selector]] and run the following command:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
python3 BiG-MAP.download.py -A Acc_list.txt -O /mnt/scratch/usr001/fastq/schirmer/

Acc_list.txt:
SRR5983273
SRR5983265
SRR5983266
SRR5983268
SRR5983270
SRR5983271
SRR5983275
...
#+END_EXAMPLE

** 2) BiG-MAP.family.py
The main purpose of this script is to compute GCFs and HGFs using
sequence similarity as sole metric. For GCF computation, protein
sequences are used while for the HGF computation DNA sequences are
used. FastANI is implemented to compute the GCFs and HGFs. The input
consists of the output directories of anti- or gutSMASH. Options can
be investigated by running the /-h/ flag. General usage is:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
python3 BiG-MAP.family.py -h
python3 BiG-MAP.family.py [Options]* -D [input dir(s)] -O [output dir]
#+END_EXAMPLE
In the example of a gutSMASH run on 1520 (draft) reference genomes that
are present in the gut, with a fastANI treshold of 0.7 for both the
GCFs and HGFs, no flanking genes of the core, no genome fasta file
outputs and 6 process cores:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
python3 BiG-MAP.family.py -tg 0.6 -th 0.8 -f 0 -g False -p 6 -D /mnt/scratch/usr001/gutSMASH-output/ -O /mnt/scratch/usr001/results/

This yields:
BiG-MAP.GCF_HGF.bed = Bedfile to extract core regions in BiG-MAP.map.py
BiG-MAP.GCF_HGF.fna = Reference file to map the WGS reads to
BiG-MAP.GCF_HGF.json = Dictionary that contains the GCFs and HGFs
#+END_EXAMPLE

** 3) BiG-MAP.map.py
This module is designed to align the WGS (paired or unpaired) reads to
the reference representatives in each GCF and HGF. It does this using
/bowtie2/. The following will be computed: RPKM, coverage, core
coverage. The coverage is calculated using /Bedtools/, and the read
count values using /Samtools/. The general usage is:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
python3 BiG-MAP.map.py {-I1 [mate-1s] -I2 [mate-2s] | -U [samples]} -R [reference] -O [outdir] -F [family] [Options*]
#+END_EXAMPLE

To map 10 reads from schirmer et al to the reference representatives
from the GCFs and HGFs, and also calculate the core metrics, run:

*NOTE*: It is important for downstream analysis to also use the /-b/ flag. 
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
python3 BiG-MAP.map.py -f False -s fast -th 10 -b /mnt/scratch/usr001/results/schirmer_metadata.txt -cc /mnt/scratch/usr001/results/BiG-MAP.GCF_HGF.bed -R /mnt/scratch/usr001/results/BiG-MAP.GCF_HGF.fna -I1 /mnt/scratch/usr001/fastq/schirmer/*pass_1* -I2 /mnt/scratch/usr001/fastq/schirmer/*pass_2* -O /mnt/scratch/usr001/results/ -F /mnt/scratch/usr001/results/BiG-MAP.GCF_HGF.json

the schirmer_metadata.txt is set up as follows (tab-delimited):
#run.ID         host.ID	        SampleType	     DiseaseStatus
SRR5947852	C3001C10_MGX	METAGENOMIC	        CD
SRR5947945	C3001C10_MTX	METATRANSCRIPTOMIC	CD
SRR5947826	C3001C5_MGX	METAGENOMIC	        CD
SRR5947900	C3001C5_MTX	METATRANSCRIPTOMIC	CD
SRR5947876	C3001C9_MGX	METAGENOMIC	        CD
SRR5947934	C3001C9_MTX	METATRANSCRIPTOMIC	CD

#+END_EXAMPLE

** 4) BiG-MAP.analyse.py
This module is a wrapper script for BiG-MAP.norm.R. I highly recommend
using this script locally in R studio, as that will ease the graphics
output. The comments in the script mention how that works. For
example:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Scroll down to the main in BiG-MAP.norm.R
Edit and uncomment:
biom_file <- "metaclust.map.biom" 
MT <- "DiseaseStatus"
sampletype <- "METATRANSCRIPTOMIC"
group_1 <- "UC"
group_2 <- "non-IBD"
explore <- TRUE

Run all the functions and analyse locally
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you want to do it from the command line (eg in automated analysis)
it works as follows:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Generic command: python3 BiG-MAP.analyse.py inspect -B [biom_file] [options*]

Example:
python3 BiG-MAP.analyse.py inspect -B /mnt/scratch/usr001/BiG-MAP.map.biom -e /mnt/scratch/usr001/ -s metagenomic -m DiseaseStatus
#+END_EXAMPLE

To perform statistical testing on the biom file, use:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Generic command: python3 BiG-MAP.analyse.py test -B [biom_file] -T [SampleType] -M [meta_group] -G [[groups]] -O [outdir]

Example:
python3 BiG-MAP.analyse.py test -B /mnt/scratch/usr001/BiG-MAP.map.biom -T metagenomic -M DiseaseStatus -G UC non-IBD -O /mnt/scratch/usr001/
