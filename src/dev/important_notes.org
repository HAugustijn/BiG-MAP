** Selecting the medoid instead of randomly selecting a MGCs from each family
To calculate a medoid, you need a distance matrix. Then, sum each row
to obtain the row totals, and select the lowest total (argmin). This will be
the MGC that has the lowest distance to all other MGcs.

This could be obtained by taking each MGC in the GCF and then taking
out the information again from the ‘fastani.results’ file to create
this distance matrix for each GCF.

Then, compute the column or row sum and apply
numpy.argmin(distMatrix.sum(axis=0))

This will be a job that will take ~4h of coding to add. So, I think
this could be something for Hannah to possibly take a look into.
